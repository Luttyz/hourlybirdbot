# Hourly Bird bot code

This Github repo contains the very simple code used by the @HourlyBird Twitter bot, it is somewhat modular and can be easily edited to send anything that can be accessed through a web API.

This should also be pretty easy code as this is the first thing I have made using Python, so even if you're a beginner this should still be easy to understand.

Check out a running example of this code at <a href="https://twitter.com/HourlyBird">@HourlyBird Twitter account</a>.
